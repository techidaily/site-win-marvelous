There will be no new features or non-security patches. If you run into trouble, technical support will be limited and require an active support plan.</p><p>In summary, commercial organizations will pay $61 to $244 per device over three years, while education gets heavily discounted pricing of $1 to $4 per license. Consumer pricing is still to be determined.</p><p>I’d only go with an ESU, myself, if I <em>really</em> had no other choice.</p><h2 id="5-Try-alternative-security-patching"><a href="#5-Try-alternative-security-patching" class="headerlink" title="5.

Then you could find yourself on the outs with Microsoft. </p><p>Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 are no longer supported by the folks in Redmond. This means that anyone still running these versions won’t receive future bug fixes, security patches, or other updates. And that could place your computer at a greater risk for malware, security flaws, and other threats.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/" >Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On Sunday, Microsoft revised its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information" >Windows 11 release information page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to indicate the retirement of the two older versions, listing both 21H2 and 22H2 as having reached the end of servicing for Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. Only the Enterprise and Education editions are spared; they’re still able to receive updates to Windows 11 22H2 until October 14 of 2025.</p><p>How do you know which version you’re running? That’s easy enough. Head to Settings, select System, and then click About. Scroll down to the section for Windows specifications to find the version. If Windows 11 23H2 is listed, then you’re fine. But what if you’re stuck with an older edition? In that case, you can update your PC yourself, or Microsoft will now do it for you.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-going-to-start-charging-for-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-how-much/" >Microsoft is going to start charging for Windows 10 updates next year. Here’s how much <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Go to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button for “Check for Updates.” Microsoft will download and install the latest updates, which will include 23H2. If you don’t do this yourself and automatic updates are turned on, the update will automatically run as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday, rolled out on September 10.</p><p>Keeping track of Windows updates can be challenging and frustrating, especially with so many of them pushed out on a regular and irregular basis. Microsoft has tried to streamline the major updates by launching them annually and naming them with the year and period. But the names can be confusing since we’re almost in the final quarter of 2024 and Windows 11 is still stuck on a 2023 version. In the midst of this messiness, making sure your PC is fully protected against security hazards is the most critical task.</p><p>On its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center" >Windows Message Center page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Microsoft issued this warning:</p><p>**”**The October 2024 security update is the last security release for Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 21H2 and Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, version 22H2. After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In the following message, Microsoft explains that it will perform the update if you fail to do so:</p><p>“To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 11 Home and Pro devices that are not managed by IT departments when these are nearing end of servicing. Moving to Windows 11, version 23H2 keeps your device supported and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How long will it be before Windows 11 23H2 is no longer supported? That depends on when 24H2 is released to the general public. Right now, this year’s major Windows 11 update is officially available only on <a class="link"   href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5043950-windows-11-version-24h2-support-2fd719b6-8c26-469f-99fe-832eb1b702d7" >Copilot PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/" >through Release Preview builds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s assume that 24H2 kicks off to everyone by the end of 2024. Then the current flavor of 23H2 should have at least another year of life left before Microsoft forces you to update again.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/"  title="6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what&#39;s coming later)">6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what’s coming later) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-your-windows-license-legal-should-you-even-care/"  title="Is your Windows license legal?

In the following parts, we’ll demonstrate the detailed process of upscaling video quality in VLC. Plus, an alternative is offered in Part 2 in case you need an easier solution. </p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-VLC-Upscale-Video-Quality"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-VLC-Upscale-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make VLC Upscale Video Quality?"></a>Part 1. How to Make VLC Upscale Video Quality?</h2><p>In this section, we’ll delve into the video quality settings available in VLC Media Player and how can you adjust them to let VLC upscale video quality. But note that upscaling a low-quality video to a high-quality video with perfect clarity in VLC is impossible. The improvement will be limited by the video’s original quality. </p><h3 id="1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects"><a href="#1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Adjust Effect Setting for Better Display Effects"></a>1. Adjust Effect Setting for Better Display Effects</h3><p>VLC offers options to change the video’s Hue, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Gamma, Sharpen, etc., helping improve the overall visual clarity. Here are the steps:</p><p>▪ Open VLC and go to <strong>Tools</strong> on the menu bar.<br> ▪ From the drop-down options, select <strong>Effects and Filters</strong>.<br> ▪ Click <strong>Video Effects</strong> and go to <strong>Essentials</strong>.<br> ▪ Check the <strong>Image adjust</strong> and move the sliders below to set the preferred Hue, Brightness, Contrast, etc. If your video looks fuzzy, you can try the <strong>Sharpen</strong> effect to make it clear.<br> ▪ As you alter the settings, you can preview the changes in real time. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-01.webp"                      alt="Adjust Effect Setting in VLC"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-01-01.webp"                      alt="Adjust Effect Setting in VLC"                > </p><p>With the above steps, the changes are directly applied to the video you’re playing in VLC. If you want to keep these effects permanently, you should:</p><p>▪ Open VLC and click <strong>Media &gt; Convert&#x2F;Save</strong>.<br> ▪ In the <strong>File</strong> section, click <strong>Add</strong> to import the video you want to upscale quality.<br> ▪ Click <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong>.<br> ▪ Select an output format from the <strong>Profile</strong> drop-down list.<br> ▪ Click the wrench icon and go to <strong>Video codec &gt; Filters</strong>.<br> ▪ Choose an appropriate filter and click <strong>Save</strong>.<br> ▪ Hit <strong>Browse</strong> to set an output folder and click <strong>Start</strong> to export the video. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-02.webp"                      alt="VLC Export Video with Effects"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-02-02.webp"                      alt="VLC Export Video with Effects"                > </p><h3 id="2-Check-the-Deinterlace-Option-for-Video-Upscaling"><a href="#2-Check-the-Deinterlace-Option-for-Video-Upscaling" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052060/7443" target="_top" id="2052060">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052060" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052060/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years.

It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

It didn’t go well <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>I received an email, you see, from the company, with a hearty New Year’s twist. The subject line was, “Try one of these creative ways to use Microsoft Excel this year.” </p><p>I confess I’d never thought I’d see a sentence that included the words “Excel” and “creative,” unless that sentence was, “If you’re just not creative at all, you might actually enjoy using Excel.” </p><p>Yet here is Microsoft with six suggestions that may inspire you to greater heights or merely drift your mind to a wintery woe.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-create-a-drop-down-list-in-excel/"><strong>How to create a drop-down list in Excel</strong></a></p><p>Firstly, Microsoft would like you to use Excel to track your fitness. </p><p>Don’t desperate fitness people already have fancy watches and apps to do just that? Don’t they adore sharing their performance data with their fitness trainers, significant friends, or just every other fitness obsessive in the world? </p><p>The mere idea of Excel somehow dramatizing or even enlightening one’s fitness numbers seems quaint.</p><p>If that doesn’t grab you either, how about using Excel to play Sudoku? I always thought people used Sudoku to play Sudoku, and there’s surely nothing playful about Excel. How would Excel enhance the Sudoku experience? I have no clue.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/"><strong>The 5 best fitness trackers</strong></a> </p><p>Microsoft’s third suggestion is equally sedentary: Follow your sports bracket.</p><p>Oh, I suppose. </p><p>I think Microsoft is specifically referring to the NCAA Tournament, without actually naming it for legal reasons. Again, though, Excel for that? Aren’t there a hundred prettier little apps that give your bracket a more glorious look? Or am I simply not giving Excel sufficient credit?</p><p>Microsoft is undeterred. If you don’t want to use Excel for your sports bracket, how about using it to plan your vacation? I actually clicked on that link from the email and found, oh, the Trip Planner with the word “worksheet” in parentheses. </p><p>I don’t want planning my trips to be work. I want them to be fun. And the templates Microsoft offers here look anything other than a day at the beach.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-trip-planner-app/"><strong>The 5 best trip planner apps</strong></a></p><p>Was Microsoft getting desperate here? I fear it’s possible. Especially as its next idea was “Create Pixel Art.” </p><p>I have no idea what this has to do with Excel as, when I clicked on the link, it took me to <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@microsoft365/video/7017812421733633285?ocid=cmm50bixyyq" >a TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of illustrations from circa 1978. One was of a waffle, I’m told, because waffles have rows and columns. </p><p>This wasn’t working on me. It just wasn’t. It wasn’t working on everyone on the TikTok page either, as there were comments, such as “Can’t open Microsoft Edge help” and “How do I get the TPM 2.0 Stick for Windows 11?”</p><p>I was feeling spent. None of these creative Excel activities felt appealing. None of them screamed at me to change my less than Excel-lent ways.</p><p>But there was one more suggestion to go. This would surely be the most creative of all. You have the leave the best for the end, surely.</p><p>Well, suggestion No. 6 was: “Organize Your Week. Stay on top of your to do list and make time for what’s important.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/best-to-do-list-app/"><strong>The 6 best to-do list apps</strong></a></p><p>Ah. Oh.</p><p>I felt Microsoft had run out of ideas. I know a lot of people use Excel for organization, so I struggled to see how this idea was in any way creative.</p><p>Please, it may well be there are many people around the world who are immensely adept at using Excel for all sorts of exciting things. Why, Microsoft itself <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-just-watched-microsoft-try-to-make-excel-exciting-recovery-wont-be-easy/" >even holds an Excel championship <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for truly exciting people. Like actuaries, I think.</p><p>I fear, though, that for very many people, Excel is just a dull, efficient, utilitarian thing, and it will always be so – until <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpts-next-big-challenge-helping-microsoft-to-challenge-google-search/" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it redundant, I suppose.</p><h4 id="More-Microsoft"><a href="#More-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="More Microsoft"></a>More Microsoft</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-windows-laptop/"  title="The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more">The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-microsoft-edge-settings-to-change-for-more-secure-browsing-than-chrome-offers/"  title="5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers">5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-windows-pc/"  title="The best VPN for Windows: Expert tested">The best VPN for Windows: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-recover-deleted-files-in-windows-10-or-11/"  title="How to recover deleted files in Windows 10 or 11">How to recover deleted files in Windows 10 or 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-windows-laptop/"  title="The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more">The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-microsoft-edge-settings-to-change-for-more-secure-browsing-than-chrome-offers/"  title="5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers">5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn-for-windows-pc/"  title="The best VPN for Windows: Expert tested">The best VPN for Windows: Expert tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-recover-deleted-files-in-windows-10-or-11/"  title="How to recover deleted files in Windows 10 or 11">How to recover deleted files in Windows 10 or 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-lyrics-notes-and-beats-fb-style/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Lyrics, Notes, and Beats -

Then you could find yourself on the outs with Microsoft. </p><p>Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 are no longer supported by the folks in Redmond. This means that anyone still running these versions won’t receive future bug fixes, security patches, or other updates. And that could place your computer at a greater risk for malware, security flaws, and other threats.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/" >Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On Sunday, Microsoft revised its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information" >Windows 11 release information page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to indicate the retirement of the two older versions, listing both 21H2 and 22H2 as having reached the end of servicing for Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. Only the Enterprise and Education editions are spared; they’re still able to receive updates to Windows 11 22H2 until October 14 of 2025.</p><p>How do you know which version you’re running? That’s easy enough. Head to Settings, select System, and then click About. Scroll down to the section for Windows specifications to find the version. If Windows 11 23H2 is listed, then you’re fine. But what if you’re stuck with an older edition? In that case, you can update your PC yourself, or Microsoft will now do it for you.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-going-to-start-charging-for-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-how-much/" >Microsoft is going to start charging for Windows 10 updates next year. Here’s how much <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Go to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button for “Check for Updates.” Microsoft will download and install the latest updates, which will include 23H2. If you don’t do this yourself and automatic updates are turned on, the update will automatically run as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday, rolled out on September 10.</p><p>Keeping track of Windows updates can be challenging and frustrating, especially with so many of them pushed out on a regular and irregular basis. Microsoft has tried to streamline the major updates by launching them annually and naming them with the year and period. But the names can be confusing since we’re almost in the final quarter of 2024 and Windows 11 is still stuck on a 2023 version. In the midst of this messiness, making sure your PC is fully protected against security hazards is the most critical task.</p><p>On its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center" >Windows Message Center page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Microsoft issued this warning:</p><p>**”**The October 2024 security update is the last security release for Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 21H2 and Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, version 22H2. After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In the following message, Microsoft explains that it will perform the update if you fail to do so:</p><p>“To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 11 Home and Pro devices that are not managed by IT departments when these are nearing end of servicing. Moving to Windows 11, version 23H2 keeps your device supported and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How long will it be before Windows 11 23H2 is no longer supported? That depends on when 24H2 is released to the general public. Right now, this year’s major Windows 11 update is officially available only on <a class="link"   href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5043950-windows-11-version-24h2-support-2fd719b6-8c26-469f-99fe-832eb1b702d7" >Copilot PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/" >through Release Preview builds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s assume that 24H2 kicks off to everyone by the end of 2024. Then the current flavor of 23H2 should have at least another year of life left before Microsoft forces you to update again.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/"  title="6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what&#39;s coming later)">6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what’s coming later) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-your-windows-license-legal-should-you-even-care/"  title="Is your Windows license legal?

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier.

Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

The subject line was, “Try one of these creative ways to use Microsoft Excel this year.” </p><p>I confess I’d never thought I’d see a sentence that included the words “Excel” and “creative,” unless that sentence was, “If you’re just not creative at all, you might actually enjoy using Excel.” </p><p>Yet here is Microsoft with six suggestions that may inspire you to greater heights or merely drift your mind to a wintery woe.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-create-a-drop-down-list-in-excel/"><strong>How to create a drop-down list in Excel</strong></a></p><p>Firstly, Microsoft would like you to use Excel to track your fitness. </p><p>Don’t desperate fitness people already have fancy watches and apps to do just that? Don’t they adore sharing their performance data with their fitness trainers, significant friends, or just every other fitness obsessive in the world? </p><p>The mere idea of Excel somehow dramatizing or even enlightening one’s fitness numbers seems quaint.</p><p>If that doesn’t grab you either, how about using Excel to play Sudoku? I always thought people used Sudoku to play Sudoku, and there’s surely nothing playful about Excel. How would Excel enhance the Sudoku experience? I have no clue.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/"><strong>The 5 best fitness trackers</strong></a> </p><p>Microsoft’s third suggestion is equally sedentary: Follow your sports bracket.</p><p>Oh, I suppose. </p><p>I think Microsoft is specifically referring to the NCAA Tournament, without actually naming it for legal reasons. Again, though, Excel for that? Aren’t there a hundred prettier little apps that give your bracket a more glorious look? Or am I simply not giving Excel sufficient credit?</p><p>Microsoft is undeterred. If you don’t want to use Excel for your sports bracket, how about using it to plan your vacation? I actually clicked on that link from the email and found, oh, the Trip Planner with the word “worksheet” in parentheses. </p><p>I don’t want planning my trips to be work. I want them to be fun. And the templates Microsoft offers here look anything other than a day at the beach.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-trip-planner-app/"><strong>The 5 best trip planner apps</strong></a></p><p>Was Microsoft getting desperate here? I fear it’s possible. Especially as its next idea was “Create Pixel Art.” </p><p>I have no idea what this has to do with Excel as, when I clicked on the link, it took me to <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@microsoft365/video/7017812421733633285?ocid=cmm50bixyyq" >a TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of illustrations from circa 1978. One was of a waffle, I’m told, because waffles have rows and columns. </p><p>This wasn’t working on me. It just wasn’t. It wasn’t working on everyone on the TikTok page either, as there were comments, such as “Can’t open Microsoft Edge help” and “How do I get the TPM 2.0 Stick for Windows 11?”</p><p>I was feeling spent. None of these creative Excel activities felt appealing. None of them screamed at me to change my less than Excel-lent ways.</p><p>But there was one more suggestion to go. This would surely be the most creative of all. You have the leave the best for the end, surely.</p><p>Well, suggestion No. 6 was: “Organize Your Week. Stay on top of your to do list and make time for what’s important.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/best-to-do-list-app/"><strong>The 6 best to-do list apps</strong></a></p><p>Ah. Oh.</p><p>I felt Microsoft had run out of ideas. I know a lot of people use Excel for organization, so I struggled to see how this idea was in any way creative.</p><p>Please, it may well be there are many people around the world who are immensely adept at using Excel for all sorts of exciting things. Why, Microsoft itself <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-just-watched-microsoft-try-to-make-excel-exciting-recovery-wont-be-easy/" >even holds an Excel championship <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for truly exciting people.
