## Step-by-Step Guide: Downloading Shutterstock Footage From PC or Mac

### Overview

* I want to download two Shutterstock nature videos to FLV format. Can you tell me how I can do that?
* I want to download some Shutterstock videos to watch for my daughter on her iPad. How do I download the Shutterstock videos to my iPad supported file formats?

On Shutterstock, users can find many royality-free videos, photos, music, etc. Normally, the Shutterstock videos can be downloaded after you paid some price as per the video file numbers and video sizes and can be redownloaded any time after you paid. Usually, Shutterstock allows users to download or redownload their paid videos with the fixed video formats, but it also comes a question, that is, the fixed video format is not fully supported by your device or media player. What should we do? There are two solutions for this problem. One is to use a video converter to convert the Shutterstock fixed output format to your device or media player supported one and the other is to use a Shutterstock downloader to directly download Shutterstock video to any video format you need. If the latter solution is what you want and then you will need a professional Shutterstock downloader, like Allavsoft.
