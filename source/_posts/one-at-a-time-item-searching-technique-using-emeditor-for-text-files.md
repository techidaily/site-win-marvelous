e.g. I’d like to search the numbers in “Column 2” against “Column 1” and output what matches.  
 I noticed that “multiline” function in EmEditor. However, I am not able to search the numbers in “Column 2” one by one but rather as a whole string.  
 Just wondering if anyone has a solution for multiple search? Thanks,

Hello Mike,  
I am not sure exactly what you want to do. Can you show me an example?  
Thank you!

Hi Thanks for your instant response!  
 This would be like a search/find function but it automatically search a list of items one by one in another file instead of enter each item manually.  
For instance:  
 1st file:  
 ID1 description  
 1 absent  
 2 present  
 3 present  
 4 absent  
 5 absent  
 6 present  
 7 present  
 8 present  
 9 absent  
 10 present  
 11 present  
 12 present  
 13 present  
 14 absent  
 15 absent  
 16 present  
 17 present  
 18 present  
 19 present  
 20 present  
 21 present  
 22 absent  
 23 absent  
 24 absent  
 25 absent  
 26 absent  
 27 absent  
 28 absent  
 29 absent  
2nd file:  
 ID2  
 1  
 5  
 7  
 3  
 23  
 5  
 24  
 12  
 25  
 2  
 6  
 11  
 18  
 16  
The results:  
 1 absent  
 5 absent  
 7 present  
 3 present  
 23 absent  
 5 absent  
 24 absent  
 12 present  
 25 absent  
 2 present  
 6 present  
 11 present  
 18 present  
 16 present

Hello Mike,  
Thanks for explanation. This is like the JOINT feature of SQL, and I was thinking about this in future versions. Please wait for future versions.  
Meanwhile, you can write a macro like this:  
```  
doc1 = editor.Documents.Item(1);  
doc2 = editor.Documents.Item(2);  
editor.NewFile();  
doc3 = document;  
doc1.Activate();  
nLines1 = doc1.GetLines();  
doc2.Activate();  
nLines2 = doc2.GetLines();  
for(y2 = 1; y2 <= nLines2; y2++) {  
	doc2.Activate();  
	s2 = doc2.GetLine(y2);  
	if(s2 == "") continue;  
	doc1.Activate();  
	for(y1 = 1; y1 <= nLines1; y1++) {  
		s1 = doc1.GetCell(y1, 1, eeCellIncludeNone);  
		if(s1 == "") continue;  
		if(s1 == s2) {  
			sResult = doc1.GetCell(y1, 2, eeCellIncludeNone);  
			doc3.Activate();  
			doc3.writeln(s2 + "\t" + sResult);  
			break;  

```  
Thanks!
