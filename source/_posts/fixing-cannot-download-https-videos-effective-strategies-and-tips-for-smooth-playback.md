## Fixing 'Cannot Download HTTPS Videos': Effective Strategies and Tips for Smooth Playback

### Overview

To my surprise, many users have encountered failure when downloading online videos especially cannot download videos from website begin with https, some of them are from our familiar websites, like YouTube, Vimeo, etc while some others are not. And also these users have posted the download links from which that they fail to download videos. For example:

* I like some YouTube videos very much and would like to download them for offline viewing on my iPhone. But the video downloader I often use can not help me with this link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rbOYH2tGY>. So can you help me?
* I need to download some featured shows on CBS and show them to my students. But I do not know how to download them. The video links are like this: <https://www.cbs.com/shows/young-sheldon/video/>. Thanks for your any answer.
* I have been downloading some funny videos from Comedy Central for my Mum, but I have no idea about how to download these Comedy Central videos. The video links are like this: <https://www.cc.com/episodes/xh08ih/idiotsitter-school-s-out-season-2-ep-207>. It will be very helpful if you can recommend me a video downloader or something like that so that I can download myself.

These are just a little part of the examples and I wish I have enough time to help you one by one, but I don't. But I can still help you with less time by introducing you a universal Https and HTTP video downloader - Allavsoft which can help to solve all 'can not download https problems'.
