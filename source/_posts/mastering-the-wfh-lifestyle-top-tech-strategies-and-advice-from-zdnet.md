## Mastering the WFH Lifestyle: Top Tech, Strategies and Advice From ZDNet

Slowly but surely, hybrid work has become the new norm. While many companies have strictly prioritized remote work setups during the past few years, [return-to-office mandates](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-ceo-says-zoom-meetings-hinder-innovation-and-debate-wants-employees-back-in-the-office/) have demonstrated that the hybrid work model is here to stay. 

I am a hybrid worker myself, and I've found it difficult to adjust to this new norm, constantly switching from one environment to another – that is, until I found the right remote work setup: the perfect combination of tech devices and gadgets that allow me to have an office at home and on the go.

Just like most things in life, remote work has its benefits and drawbacks, but with the right tools, you can make the most out of every situation--or in this case, every environment--to be your most productive self at all times. As a remote worker for more than two decades, [ZDNET's David Gewirtz](https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-easy-switch-switching-mice-and-keyboards-between-computers-is-so-un-kvm/) believes "the more optimized your space is, the more productivity improves." 

ZDNET has tried and tested the following products to ensure you get the best remote work setup possible.

## **A laptop**

Whether you plan to work from a designated area in your house or at the local coffee shop, [a laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) is a must-have essential for remote work. A laptop can provide the flexibility to work anywhere without being bound to a specific place, something desktops or PCs can't do. If you are looking for the best laptops to work remotely, here are some of our favorite reviewed and tested picks.

Apple's 2023 Macbook Pro with the M2 chip is the best choice for writers, creatives, engineers, and even business leaders who seek a powerful top-performing laptop. You can work long hours without needing to charge thanks to its incredibly reliant 22-hour battery life and you can count on its loud speakers to provide the most crisp and detailed sounds while you work.

## **A monitor**

Working nine to five on a laptop five days a week is not ideal--there is no denying after several hours, your back, eyes, and entire body just start to hurt from crouching over such a small screen. Besides, you can do so much more when you have two screens to organize your work. For at-home or on-the-go setups, here are the [top monitors](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-curved-monitor/) to work remotely.

## **A desk and a chair** 

I've tried multiple times to work from my kitchen table, and let me tell you, it just doesn't work as a permanent fix. If you are working from home or remotely, you need a designated workspace where you can keep all of your work-related essentials. Not only will your significant other thank you for not hogging the kitchen table, but you will also be able to create a physical distinction between what is work and what is home. Here are some of our favorite [office furniture](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/office-furniture/), including desks and chairs.

Personally, I need to stand while working to prevent my head from slamming into my desk after having a meal. Standing desks have become popular options that allow you to raise the height of your desk so you can stand and work (and decrease the negative effects of sitting for hours a day). The Vari Electric Standing Desk has a gorgeous design, programmable height settings, and it is incredibly easy to set up and get working.

## **A keyboard and a mouse**

An external keyboard and mouse is definitely up to personal preference, but if you are using a monitor, having a [top-quality keyboard](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-keyboard/) and mouse can be more comfortable to use and can provide a better flow of work than performing functions directly on your laptop. Besides, unless you have your monitor higher than your laptop, your screens may interfere, or it may be uncomfortable to type with your computer on the side.

## What does remote work mean?

Working remotely is often referred to as working at any location other than a company's central office. This means employees use online forums to meet, communicate, and go about their daily tasks. For some employees, working remotely can mean working from home, while for others, it can mean working on-the-go.

## What is the difference between remote work, work from home, and hybrid work?

Employees who work from home have their offices and work setups at--you guessed it--home. Remote workers are technically those who work at any location that is not the company's central office and, in turn, are nowhere near other coworkers. Hybrid workers work half their time in a company's main office and half remotely -- a trend that has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic.

## What should I keep in mind when working remotely?

While working remotely offers immense flexibility, you must be mindful of certain "side effects." First and foremost, the lines between work and play can be blurred. If you want to succeed at a remote job, you must distinguish between your work and home setup. While this can be physical, such as a designated work space within your home or a specific work schedule, it can also be mental; this means creating boundaries of when and where you want to answer messages, send Slacks, or even log into your laptop. 

Secondly, it is essential to keep in mind cybersecurity at all costs. While you may consider you are not at risk since you are in the comfort of your own home or paying attention to your laptop at all times within your local coffee shop, you may be compromising your company's security.
